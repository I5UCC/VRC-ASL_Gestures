### If you decide to Enable Thumbparams you need to use this additional program:

### [I5UCC - VRCThumbParamsOSC](https://github.com/I5UCC/VRCThumbParamsOSC) 

### This program exposes Thumbpositions (or even more) to VRChat and make the use of those Animators possible in the first place. You can get more information in the corresponding Repository above.
