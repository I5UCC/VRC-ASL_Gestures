### If you decide to Enable Thumbparams you need to use this additional program:

### [I5UCC - VRCThumbParamsOSC](https://github.com/I5UCC/VRCThumbParamsOSC) 

### These programs expose Thumbpositions (or even more) to VRChat and make the use of those Animators possible in the first place. You can get more informations in the corresponding Repository above.
