Gesture Controllers for VRChat 3.0 Avatars to be able to do more ASL Handshapes. 

This Repository has different gesture controllers that can be used, dependent on the controller you use:
- Index Controller
  - using [ThumbParams](https://github.com/I5UCC/VRC-ASL_Gestures/blob/954e2dc852c1f07d76ef352c9473eb8412aaf3a1/ThumbParamsInfo.md). ***(Recommended)***
  - without any additional programs ***(Left/Right Hand Dominant versions available)***.
- GeneralVR ***(made for Oculus Touch)***
  - using [ThumbParams](https://github.com/I5UCC/VRC-ASL_Gestures/blob/954e2dc852c1f07d76ef352c9473eb8412aaf3a1/ThumbParamsInfo.md). ***(Only Recommended if you use a Controller grip)***
  - without any additional programs ***(Left/Right Hand Dominant versions available)***.
 - A combined Controller that combines all of the Options above! (Great for public or sold avatars)

# FAQ

- When are you gonna fix {add issue here}?
  - Whenever I have time for it. I also have a life of my own and cant always work on my other projects. This is something I did in my spare time to provide for free and its gonna stay like that of course. Please keep that in mind. Problems with the Index version of the controllers are gonna be updated faster then the GeneralVR ones, as I currently only own an Index.
- Why cant people see my signs sometimes?
  - Only people who have your avatar shown or Custom animations enabled in Safety-settings are able to see the additional signs, make sure that is the case.
- The animations don't fit my Avatar.
  - The animations used in this Gesture Controller are made with [Pandaabear's base](https://pandaabear.gumroad.com/l/pAxQR). However they should work with basically any Avatar but might require small adjustments for more complex signs like E-Hand or R-Hand. There are some alternative Animations in the 
"Alternative Animations" folder, That you are able to use too. 
- What if my Avatar uses Write Defaults on?
  - Shouldn't be a problem. you can set all of the animations WD on if you use WD in your Gesture Layer, that shouldn't cause problems, I would still recommend having WD off, as VRChat recommends it.
