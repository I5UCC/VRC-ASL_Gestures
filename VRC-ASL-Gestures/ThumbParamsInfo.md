### If you decide to Enable Thumbparams you need to use one of these two things:

### For all controllers : [VRCThumbParamsOSC](https://github.com/I5UCC/VRCThumbParamsOSC)
### For Index only : [VRCThumbParams](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCThumbParams) (Does not work anymore adue to EAC)

### These programs expose Thumbpositions to VRChat and make the use of those Animators possible in the first place. You can get more informations on their corresponding Repositories above.
